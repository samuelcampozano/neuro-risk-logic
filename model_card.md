- **AUC-ROC**: 0.91 ± 0.02

### Performance by Subgroup
| Subgroup | Accuracy | AUC-ROC |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Age < 18 | 86.1% | 0.92 |
| Age 18-65 | 84.8% | 0.90 |
| Age > 65 | 83.2% | 0.89 |
| Male | 85.5% | 0.91 |
| Female | 84.9% | 0.91 |

### Confusion Matrix
```
                 Predicted
              Low Risk  High Risk
Actual Low Risk   412      38
      High Risk    42     508
```

## Limitations

### Known Limitations
1. **Data Representativeness**: Initial training on synthetic data
2. **Geographic Bias**: Feature weights may vary by region
3. **Temporal Validity**: Risk factors may change over time
4. **Cultural Factors**: Some features may have different implications across cultures

### Recommended Mitigations
- Regular retraining with real clinical data
- Local validation before deployment
- Continuous monitoring of predictions
- Clinical oversight for all assessments

## Ethical Considerations

### Fairness
- Model tested for bias across gender and age groups
- Balanced representation in training data
- Regular fairness audits recommended

### Privacy
- No personally identifiable information stored
- All assessments require explicit consent
- Data retention policies clearly defined

### Transparency
- Feature importance scores available
- Predictions include confidence scores
- Clinical recommendations provided

## Clinical Validation

### Validation Process
1. Feature selection validated by clinical experts
2. Risk thresholds aligned with clinical guidelines
3. Output recommendations reviewed by practitioners

### Clinical Integration
- Designed to complement, not replace, clinical judgment
- Provides risk factors and protective factors
- Generates actionable recommendations
