2. Include relevant citations
3. Update feature definitions in `data/feature_definitions.json`
4. Add appropriate tests
5. Update documentation

#### ML Model Improvements

## Development Process

### 1. Local Development

```bash
# Run tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html

# Run linting
flake8 app/
black app/ --check
mypy app/

# Run the application
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### 2. Testing Requirements

- All new features must have tests
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Include both unit and integration tests
- Test edge cases and error conditions

### 3. Documentation

- Update README.md if adding features
- Add docstrings to all functions/classes
- Update API documentation
- Include examples where appropriate

## Style Guidelines

### Python Code Style

We follow PEP 8 with some modifications:

- Line length: 88 characters (Black default)
- Use type hints for function arguments and returns
- Use descriptive variable names
- Add docstrings to all public functions

**Example:**
```python
from typing import Dict, List, Optional

def calculate_risk_score(
    features: Dict[str, Any],
    weights: Optional[Dict[str, float]] = None
) -> float:
    """
    Calculate neurodevelopmental risk score.
    
    Args:
        features: Dictionary of clinical features
        weights: Optional custom feature weights
        
    Returns:
        Risk score between 0.0 and 1.0
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If required features are missing
    """
    # Implementation
    pass
```

### API Design

- Use consistent naming conventions
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes
- Include error details in responses
- Version the API appropriately

### Database Schema

- Use meaningful table and column names
- Add comments to complex fields
- Include appropriate indexes
- Maintain referential integrity

## Commit Messages

We use conventional commits format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```
